  <h2>Bottom-Up Representation</h2>

  <p>
    This campaign is built on direct involvement from the people who live in the district.
    I believe representation should grow from the community and reflect the priorities
    of the residents who experience the results of federal decisions every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The website is hosted on GitHub to support open participation. Anyone can propose
    improvements or corrections. Every suggestion is reviewed before it is added.
    This structure encourages transparency and invites residents to take part in the
    work of building a stronger district.

  <h2>My Approach to Party Alignment</h2>
  <p>
    I consider myself a Constitutionalist. My views do not fit neatly within either
    major party. To run a community-focused campaign, I need a practical path that
    allows me to meet the legal requirements for ballot access and reach voters
    across the district. The Republican ballot line provides that path in this
    election cycle. My commitment remains centered on the people of the district
    and on the principles that guide my work.

  <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
  <p>
    A grassroots campaign depends on steady involvement from residents. Every
    conversation and every connection strengthens the effort to build a more
    responsive form of representation.
