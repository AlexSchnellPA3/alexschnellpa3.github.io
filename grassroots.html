  <h2>Bottom-Up Representation</h2>

  <p>
    This is a grassroots campaign built on steady involvement from residents of PA-3. Representation works best when it grows from the community and reflects the priorities of the people who experience federal decisions every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every conversation and every connection strengthens the effort to build more responsive representation.

  <h2>Open by Design</h2>
  <p>
    This website is hosted on GitHub to support transparency and public participation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Anyone can propose improvements or corrections. Every suggestion is reviewed before it is added. Nothing appears on this site without consideration and accountability.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Transparency is built into the structure of the campaign, not added as an afterthought.
  </p>

  <h2>Participation Matters</h2>

  <p>
	Real political change begins locally. Voting is important, but it is not the only form of civic responsibility.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Local office shapes state outcomes. State outcomes shape federal outcomes. Progress starts when people step forward rather than waiting for someone else to act.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	This campaign encourages residents of all political backgrounds to engage, participate, and think independently.
