  <h2>The Person Behind @AlexSchnellPA3 on X</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, everyone. I am Alex Schnell, a member of the Philadelphia 9th Ward Republican
    Committee, and I am exploring a grassroots run for Congress in Pennsylvania’s
    3rd District. My interest in public service grew from years of community involvement
    and from a professional background focused on analysis, problem solving, and
    practical results.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in technology began early in life through projects I worked on with my
    father. We built weather stations, created videos with green screen effects, and
    experimented with robotics and circuitry. These experiences encouraged me to pursue
    technical work and shaped the way I approach complex problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    In high school, I assisted with the IT Lab and Lab Manager programs and earned two
    Microsoft certifications after graduation. During college, I focused on gaining
    practical experience. I earned a SAS Certificate in Business Intelligence and
    Analytics and a Leadership Certificate from the Oskin Leadership Institute. I
    completed internships, including one in the office of my Congressman, and I served
    as President of Widener’s foreign language honor society and Treasurer of the
    Catholic club.
  </p>

  <p>
    After college, I spent four years at Breakaway Technologies. When that position
    ended, I used the skills I had gained to build a custom database for stock market
    forecasting. I also became more involved in public service and was elected as a
    local Committeeperson. This role strengthened my interest in government and
    community engagement and helped shape my decision to explore a run for Congress.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work as a Business Analyst through a partnership between my company
    and the Philadelphia Parking Authority. My responsibilities involve improving
    processes, supporting operations, and helping the organization function
    efficiently. These experiences have reinforced my belief that effective
    representation requires clear communication, careful analysis, and consistent
    engagement with the people you serve.
  </p>

  <p>
    I consider myself a Constitutionalist. I value limited government, individual
    liberty, and accountability. I do not align fully with either major party. I am
    choosing the path that allows a community-focused campaign to function effectively
    and reach the people who live here. My goal is to build a campaign that reflects
    the district and encourages residents to take part in shaping their representation.

  <h2>Why I Am Running</h2>

  <p>
    Many residents feel that their concerns do not reach Washington. They want a
    representative who spends time in the district, listens to local voices, and
    understands the issues that affect daily life. I believe effective representation
    begins with consistent engagement in the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to build a campaign that grows from the ground up. Community first.
    Local involvement. Clear communication. These principles guide my approach and
    shape the work I hope to do on behalf of the district.
