  <h2>The Person Behind @AlexSchnellPA3 on X</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, I’m Alex Schnell. I am a member of the Philadelphia 9th Ward Republican Committee and I am exploring a grassroots run for Congress in Pennsylvania’s 3rd District.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in public service grew from years of community involvement and from a professional background centered on analysis, problem solving, and practical results. I believe effective representation requires time spent in the district, clear communication, and an honest understanding of how federal decisions affect daily life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work as a Business Analyst supporting operations and process improvement through a partnership with the Philadelphia Parking Authority. My work focuses on making systems function more efficiently and responsibly. Those same principles guide how I approach representation.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I Am Running</h2>

  <p>
    Many residents feel that their concerns do not reach Washington. Too often, decisions are made far from the neighborhoods they affect. I believe representation should begin with consistent engagement in the community and with listening before legislating.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trust in government cannot be demanded. It is built through transparency, accountability, and steady involvement. My goal is to run a campaign that reflects the district and invites residents to take part in shaping their representation.

  This campaign is community first, local in focus, and grounded in clear communication.

  <h2>Ballot Access and Party Line</h2>
  
  <p>
	Pennsylvania’s ballot access laws create significant barriers for grassroots and independent candidates. Collecting signatures must happen within a short window, and candidates outside the major parties often face higher thresholds without organizational support.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	To run a viable, community-focused campaign and meet these legal requirements, I am running on the Republican ballot line in this election cycle. This choice provides a practical path to ballot access and voter outreach in PA-3.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	My approach remains independent in spirit and in practice. My commitment is to the people of the district and to the principles that guide my work, not to party leadership or political machines.
