  <h2>The Person Behind @AlexSchnellPA3</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, everyone. I’m Alex Schnell, a committee person for Philadelphia’s 9th Ward,
    and I’m exploring a run for Congress to represent Pennsylvania’s 3rd District.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m tired of seeing our communities divided by political labels that don’t reflect
    how people actually live. Everywhere I go, people care about the same things:
    safe neighborhoods, honest government, strong schools, and leaders who show up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went to rallies across the political spectrum not to pick sides, but to listen.
    I spoke with Democrats, Republicans, and independents while canvassing and in daily life.
    What I found was unity being drowned out by a system that benefits from division.

  <h2>Why I’m Running</h2>

  <p>
    Too often, representatives govern from Washington instead of representing their districts.
    They sit far away, make rules for the entire country, and rarely return to the communities
    they’re supposed to serve.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe representation should be bottom-up. Community first. Local voices matter.
    I focus on what I call pocketbook issues because they give people real influence
    over their government, regardless of party.
