  <h2>Enumerated Powers and Constitutional Responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    The Constitution establishes a federal government with specific and limited authority.
    Article I, Section 8 outlines the responsibilities of Congress and provides the framework
    for federal action. These powers form the basis of lawful governance and guide how federal
    programs should operate.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Collect taxes</li>
    <li>Spend for national purposes</li>
    <li>Borrow money</li>
    <li>Coin and regulate money</li>
    <li>Regulate interstate and foreign commerce</li>
    <li>Establish post offices and roads</li>
    <li>Define citizenship</li>
    <li>Create uniform bankruptcy laws</li>
    <li>Protect patents and copyrights</li>
    <li>Create lower federal courts</li>
    <li>Define and punish piracy</li>
    <li>Declare war</li>
    <li>Raise and support armies and navies</li>
    <li>Call forth the militia</li>
    <li>Make laws necessary and proper to carry out these responsibilities</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These powers provide a clear structure for federal action. They also set boundaries.
    Federal programs should be connected to the responsibilities listed in the Constitution.
    This approach strengthens accountability and helps prevent the expansion of authority
    into areas that belong to states, local communities, or individuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    I support a constitutional approach that respects these limits. A government that follows
    its defined responsibilities is more predictable, more transparent, and more responsive
    to the people it serves. This approach encourages careful budgeting, clear priorities,
    and a stronger focus on national responsibilities such as defense, interstate commerce,
    and the protection of individual rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to promote policies that reflect this framework. I support legislation that
    aligns with the powers listed in the Constitution and I support efforts to review federal
    programs that fall outside this structure. A clear constitutional foundation helps create
    a government that is stable, efficient, and respectful of the people who grant it authority.
