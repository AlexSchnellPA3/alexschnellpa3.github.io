  <h2>Issues That Give People Influence</h2>
  <p>
    Pocketbook issues are not partisan. 
    They are structural issues that determine whether people 
    have a real say in how they are governed.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="callout">
  <strong>Influence belongs to the people, not political machines.</strong><br>
  Trust requires transparency and accountability.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Term Limits</h2>
  <p>
    Career politicians distort representation. 
    I support limiting House members to three terms 
    and Senators to two. Even if Congress refuses, 
    I commit to no more than three terms myself.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Transparency and Accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Trust requires transparency. That means audits, 
    protected whistleblowers, and releasing long-withheld 
    government files including those related to Epstein, 
    MLK, JFK, and others.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Clean Money in Politics</h2>
  <p>
    We do not represent people in other states. 
    Campaign donations should come from within the district. 
    Corporate lobbying and outside money dilute local voices.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Ballot Access and Independent Voters</h2>
  <p>
    Independent voters face unfair barriers in Pennsylvania. 
    Short signature windows and high thresholds protect incumbents, 
    not voters. Representation should not require party loyalty.
