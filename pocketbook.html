  <h2>Issues That Give People Influence</h2>
  <p>
    When people ask why I am running for Congress, I explain that this is a
    grassroots effort. I have never supported the traditional top-down approach to
    representation. Many residents rarely see their elected officials in the community.
    Decisions are made in Washington while the concerns of local neighborhoods receive
    limited attention. I believe representation should begin with regular engagement
    in the district and with a clear understanding of the daily challenges people face.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach focuses on what I call pocketbook items. These are structural issues
    that determine how much influence people have in public life. They shape the
    relationship between citizens and their government and they affect the ability
    of individuals to participate in the political process.
  </p>

  <strong>Influence belongs to the people, not political machines.</strong><br>
  Trust grows when government actions are open and accountable.

  <h2>Term Limits</h2>
  <p>
    Long political careers weaken the connection between elected officials and the
    communities they serve. Many people believe that regular turnover strengthens
    accountability. I support limiting House members to three terms and Senators to
    two. I also commit to serving no more than three terms in the House. This approach
    encourages new perspectives and keeps elected officials focused on the people who
    live in their districts.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Transparency and Accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Public trust depends on clear and accessible information. Many government records
    remain sealed for long periods of time, including files related to major historical
    events and investigations. I support releasing these records, strengthening
    protections for whistleblowers, and conducting regular audits. Transparency helps
    the public evaluate government actions and strengthens confidence in our
    institutions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Clean Money in Politics</h2>
  <p>
    Campaign funding should reflect the interests of the people who live in our district. I support limiting donations to individuals and organizations within
    the jurisdiction. Large contributions from outside groups reduce the influence of
    local residents and shift attention away from community needs. Local voices
    should guide local representation.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Ballot Access and Independent Voters</h2>
  <p>
    In Pennsylvania, candidates who want to appear on the Primary Election ballot must
    collect signatures from registered voters during a three-week petition period that
    usually begins in mid-to-late February. This requirement applies to every candidate,
    but the impact is very different for those who are not running as Republicans or
    Democrats. Independent and unaffiliated candidates often need more signatures and
    do not have the organizational support that major party committees provide. These
    conditions make it extremely difficult for independent candidates to qualify for
    the ballot within the short timeframe.
  </p>

  <p>
    This situation affects my own path as well. I consider myself a Constitutionalist
    and I do not align fully with either major party. To run a grassroots campaign that
    focuses on community involvement, I need a practical route that allows me to meet
    the legal requirements and reach voters. The Democratic field already includes
    several candidates, while the Republican field does not. This creates a clearer
    path for ballot access and community outreach. For this reason, I am running as a
    Republican in name while maintaining an independent approach in spirit and in
    practice.
