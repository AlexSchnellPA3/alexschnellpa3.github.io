  <h2>Pocketbook Items</h2>
  <p>
    My approach focuses on what I call pocketbook items. These are structural issues that determine how much influence people have in public life. They shape the relationship between citizens and their government and affect the ability of individuals to participate meaningfully in the political process.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="callout">
  <strong>Influence belongs to the people, not political machines.</strong><br>
  Trust grows when government actions are open and accountable.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Term Limits</h2>
  <p>
    Long political careers weaken the connection between elected officials and the communities they serve. Regular turnover strengthens accountability and brings new perspectives.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I support limiting House members to three terms and Senators to two terms. I also commit to serving no more than three terms in the House.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Transparency and Accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Public trust depends on clear and accessible information. Many government records remain sealed for decades, including files related to major historical events and investigations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I support:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Releasing long-sealed records where appropriate</li>
    <li>Strengthening protections for whistleblowers</li>
    <li>Conducting regular audits of federal programs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
	Transparency allows the public to evaluate government actions and strengthens confidence in our institutions.
  </p>  
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Campaign Funding and Local Influence</h2>
  <p>
    Campaign funding should reflect the interests of the people who live in the district. I support limiting donations to individuals and organizations within the jurisdiction.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Local voices should guide local representation. Large outside contributions shift attention away from community needs and reduce public trust.

  <h3>From Platform to Action</h3>
  <p>
    Government works best when it is open to the people it serves. I am making my legislative priorities public now so you can see exactly how I intend to vote and lead.
