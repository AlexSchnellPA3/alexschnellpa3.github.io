**Live Site:** [alexschnellpa3.com](https://alexschnellpa3.com)

This is the official grassroots campaign website for Alex Schnell, hosted on GitHub Pages.

The site is intentionally simple:
- **HTML and CSS only:** Fast, lightweight, and easy to read.
- **No frameworks or tracking:** We respect your privacy and your data.
- **Open to community contribution:** Anyone can propose improvements.
- **Changes reviewed before merging:** Transparency with oversight.

Transparency is not a slogan here. It is the structure.
