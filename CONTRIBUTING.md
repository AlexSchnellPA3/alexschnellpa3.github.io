# Contributing to the Alex Schnell for PA-3 Campaign

Thank you for helping us build a more transparent, community-led campaign. This website is a living document, and we appreciate your input.

## Our Standards
All contributions must remain respectful and focused on the mission of local representation.

### We welcome proposals for:
- **Wording improvements:** Fixing typos or making language more concise.
- **Clarifications:** Making policy points easier to understand.
- **Community sections:** Adding information relevant to PA-3 neighborhoods.
- **Accessibility:** Improving alt-text, structure, or readability for all users.

### We do not accept:
- **Partisan attacks:** Content that disparages others rather than promoting our values.
- **Unauthorized endorsements:** All endorsements must go through a formal campaign approval process.
- **Fundraising:** No external links to donation tools or financial mechanisms.
- **Core principles:** Changes to the core constitutional principles of this campaign.

## Technical Requirements (Enforced by Automated Checks)
To keep the site fast, organized, and professional, we have "Robots" (GitHub Actions) that check every Pull Request. To ensure your change passes:

### 1. File Organization
- **Webpages:** All `.html` files must stay in the root directory.
- **Styles:** Any CSS changes must be made within the `css/style.css` file.
- **Images:** All images **must** be placed in the `images/` folder.

### 2. Naming Conventions
Our automated system will reject files that do not follow these naming rules:
- **Lowercase only:** No capital letters (e.g., use `rally.jpg`, not `Rally.jpg`).
- **No spaces:** Use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `community-meeting.jpg`).
- **Descriptive prefixes:** Try to use prefixes like `event-`, `loc-`, or `person-`.

### 3. Image Optimization
- Please ensure images are compressed (ideally under 500KB) to ensure the site remains accessible to voters with slow mobile data.

## The Review Process
1. **Fork & Branch:** Create a new branch for your suggestion.
2. **Submit PR:** Open a Pull Request. The automated "Folder Structure Guard" will run immediately.
3. **Approval:** Alex or a campaign team member will review the content. We may suggest edits to align with the campaign's voice before merging.

*By contributing, you agree that your suggestions may be used and edited by the campaign.*
